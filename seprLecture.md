Introduction
============

Main Idea
---------

When working on a project, you want to be able to keep track of changes. This is
true for several reasons:

1. Finding bugs becomes easier
2. Collaboration is encouraged
3. Finding the most up-to-date version becomes trivial

Additionally, version controls can perform the role of backing up your work (if
used properly!).

Types of Version Control
------------------------

There are many different types of version control. Luckily, they can all be
organised into one of two philosophies.

* Centralised
* Decentralised

We will look at a version control system from each of those categories and
explain their motivation.

Take Away
---------

More than being a tutorial on how to *use* version control, this lecture is
aimed at convincing you that version control is a *good thing*\texttrademark.
